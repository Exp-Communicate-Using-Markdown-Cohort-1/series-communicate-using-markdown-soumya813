# Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. 
Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
